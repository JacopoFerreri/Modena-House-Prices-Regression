# Modena-House-Prices-Regression
A ML Regression model to predict house prices in the Modena Province (Italy) relying on house sales websites data

About the notebook (Modena_Province_House_Prices_Analysis.ipynb):
This notebook was developed as part of the hand-on personal projects of IBM Machine Learning Professionnal Certificate course.

About the dataset (modena_housing_data.csv):
The dataset used in this analysis was retrieved from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/albertostefani/modena-housing-price

Precise info about the dataset can be found inside the notebook in the "Dataset description" paragraph.

An additional dataset (geonames-all-cities-with-a-population-1000.csv) was used to add the city geospatial coordinates. It is publicly available at: https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/geonames-all-cities-with-a-population-1000/table/?disjunctive.cou_name_en&sort=name

#### Research question:
Is it possible to predict houses' sale price through regression only by using online available data?

#### Structure of the research:
To answer this question, a research was conducted using a publicly available dataset about listed houses in the Modena province in July 2023 on a popular house sales websites. After some data exploration and cleaning, several regreession models are developed: Simple Linear Regression model, Polynomial Regression model, Ridge Regression model and Lasso Regression model. Finally, from the resulting model performance it is decided which one is the most appropriate and from its performance coclusions will be taken.
